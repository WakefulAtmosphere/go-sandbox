A rather minimalist Go board for setting and doing puzzles

Doing Go puzzles found in books is fun and essential for improving as a player. But I do not happen to own a physical board, and can't be bothered to find a good one for my purposes online. 

If you want to play with someone else, or are looking for a board that takes care of the bookkeeping for you, keep looking. If you want to just privately place some stones and study the board, then npm install, npm start, and privately place some stones and study the board!
